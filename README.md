------Lab 1: Become familiar using VSCode with node.js
-----------Project 1:
-Gain experience accessing your operating system's command line interface (CLI)
-Gain experience working with CLI commands
-Gain experience working with Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
-Gain experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code

------Lab 2: Use CLI commands for directory and file manipulation and use CLI commands for git commands
-----------Project 2:
-Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create and work with a git repository (repo)
-Refactor the JavaScript program from the previous project to practice using git and practice refactoring
-Use git via VSCode

------Lab 3: 
-Practice refactoring JavaScript code to use more modern syntax
-Practice destructuring an object
-Practice converting normal functions into arrow function expressions
------Lab 4: Create a fastify Node.js web server
----------Project 3:
-Create a "coin" module capable of demoninating different values of coins
-After creating the code, we made a web server displaying the code as a true fastify Node.js server

------Lab 5: Use postman to publish work folders
----------Project 4:
-You will be creating a REST API that works with a "data" source of questions and answers. You will create all of the code to work with the data source using a code module, and test the code module code using provided testing code. You will also create a Node.js REST API to handle the GET verb. 

------Lab 6: Create object classes and be able to add and delete object from those classes.
------Lab 7: Creating my own github repository
---------Project 6: 
-You will be creating three classes. The first class is the Shape class that will serve as a base class for the other two classes. The second class is the Rectangle class that will inherit from Shape class. A class that inherits from another class can be called the child class of the base, or parent, class. The third class is the Triangle class that also will inherit from the Shape class.

------Lab 8: Use fastify to execute functions
------Lab 9: Practice with GitHub
---------Project 7:
-Creating this page!
